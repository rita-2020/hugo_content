### Using Tesseract 'Optical Character Recognition' for Arabic print scans.

> #### Installing Tesseract
>
> - Follow the [instructions in tesseracts documentation][tut] to install required tools for a version >=4 (for mac I used HomeBrew,& then `git clone tesseract` ). 
> - To check if installation was succesfull, type in terminal `tesseract man` to prompt the manual.  
> - Read [Post-Installation Instructions][tut2] which concerns adding needed languages. 
> - Download the ara.traineddata file from the [tessdata_best][tut4] repository (which is trained at Google!), and any other need languages. Make sure to also download the osd.traineddata file, used for Orientation Script Detection.
> - Place the downloaded .traineddata files in the default location `/usr/local/share/tessdata` for linux & OS X. 
> - In Terminal type `tesseract --list -langs`, and you should the list of languages you downloaded.
> - Finally, follow the [Command Line Usage][tut3] samples. :)
> 
> - for multiple pages, such as a scanned book, best results work with a multitiff file, command promted normally. Otherwise, you may call multiple pages in return of seperate files: `for i in *.tif ; do tesseract $i outtext$i -l ar pdf;  done;` (for mac Terminal)
